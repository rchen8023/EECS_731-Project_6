# EECS_731-Project_6
In this project, I used three anomaly detection models to determine anomalies, which are Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM

# Project Instruction
The real world does not slow down for bad data
1.  Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2.  Download the benchmark data set from
https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab  or
https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data  
3.  Load the  one  of the data set into panda data frames
4.  Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
5.  Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the  anomalies  using the other columns as features
6.  Document your process and results
7.  Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

# Datasets

# Results
As the result, all three models are able to determine anomalies, and the performance of each model can be changed by modify the parameters of each model.
